# Setup camp
Both Nandonalt and Syrchalis have stepped away from the RimWorld modding scene, as such I am adopting the mod and will be maintaining it going forward.

Set up camp, once again!

## Main Features
For all your caravan managing needs, you can now set up camp anywhere. This let's you travel to hunt, forage and mine without having to 'settle' every time.

## Summary
Settings:
- Map size range - how large camp maps will be
- Leaving timer - when you are forced to leave, set to zero to disable
- Abandoned camp duration - how long the abandoned camp will block the tile after leaving, set to zero to disable
- Enable resource - spawns camp maps with resources
- Enable permanent camps - allows camps to remain on the map when empty
- Enable caravan/normal events - allows these events to happen on the camp map
It is advisable to use the default settings. Turning off the leaving timer and/or the abandoned camp duration will make this mod vastly more overpowered. You can turn on events if you intend to use camps for longer periods of time.

Adjusting the leaving timer setting will affect existing camps in special ways:
- Increasing the leaving timer will add time to existing camps
- Decreasing the leaving timer will not affect existing camps
- Setting the leaving timer to zero will remove the timer from existing camps
- Setting the leaving timer from zero to non-zero will add a timer to existing camps

Note: Permanent camps allows camps to keep existing if all pawns leave. It does not overwrite the leaving timer, to do that you need to set the leaving timer to zero.

## Compatibility
Safe to add to existing game saves (if no active caravans). Like most mods, remove at your own risk.

Incompatibilities:
None

A note about ghost pawns:
If you leave a camp empty, while you have 'permanent camps' on, there will be an empty square in the colonist bar. This seems to be a vanilla feature, not a bug, as the same happens with settlements.
