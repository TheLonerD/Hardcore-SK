# Designator Shapes
Allows you to build, mine, zone, etc. in various shapes, such as (both filled and outline):
- Line (including diagonal and freeform)
- Rectangle
- Ellipse
- Circle
- Pentagon
- Hexagon
Also includes these pre-defined object shapes (both filled and outline):
- Sun lamp
- Orbital trade beacon

See the shape dictionary in the mod settings!

There's also a flood-fill tool, as well as undo/redo functionality when the game is paused.

## To use:
- Select the task you want to do (build, mine, zone, etc.)
- Select the shape you want to draw in the shapes menu
- Shapes with a "+" sign on them enter a sub-menu. Select the shape from within that menu
  - Some sub-menus have additional sub-menus. The "+" sign goes deeper into a sub-menu, the "-" sign goes back out
  - Within the rectangle and ellipse sub-menu are the "size input shapes" menu. From here you can define a width and height in the input menu and it will draw that shape in the given size from the middle.
- Use the rotate keys to rotate the shape
- Use the F key (or the key you have bound to "forbid item") to toggle filling of corners.
- There's a setting to allow you to add a "toggle" button that will collapse the menu and restore vanilla functionality.

There are settings you can adjust for flood-fill, the style of menu navigation, and the size and location of the shape menu. You can also drag the menu to put it wherever is most comfortable for you.

## MOD COMPATABILITY:
This mod is generally compatible with other mods no matter the load order. If you are using this with a mod that has rotatable elements (such as RimFactory's conveyor belts), you have three options to preserve RimFactory's rotation instead of Designator Shape's:
1) If you have a shape selected that isn't rotatable (lines, cutouts) then rotation is passed down to the other mod. There's nothing you need to do.
2) If you want the other-mod's rotation to work no matter the shape (e.g. rectangles), there is an option to disable rotation keys in the mod setting.
3) You can rebind the rotation keys to different keys if want both.
